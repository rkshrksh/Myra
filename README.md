# Myra

Myra is an interface for the Smart Mirror that I created as a part of my Final year project in my graduation (2017).

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm] to install and run Myra.

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run start
```

## Usage

I ran this app interface on a Raspberry Pi. After bootup this code used to on Startup. The interface was setuped to run in full-screen mode. If you need any help in running or understanding the code, feel free to contact me.

I have not removed many of the API keys from the code. But the API keys are old and expired, so replace them with your own, when using.

The code is very old, so use it at your own risk. :D

## Contributing

I created this in my B.tech final year. So, the code is very old and most of the libraries used are deprecated.

You are welcome to update or contribute.
